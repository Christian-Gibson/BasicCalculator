Basic four function calculator

Simple calculator made using C# and XAML. Two numbers inputted by the user in two seperate TextBoxes are converted to strings, parsed into doubles, then converted back to a string in the answer box after the doubles are operated on with the corresponding operator button (+,-,x,/) Includes exception handling for non-number input. *To be updated
